I am an Assistant Professor in European Politics and Society at the University of Groningen specializing in comparative politics and welfare policy, Euroscepticism, democratic innovations, and differentiated European (dis)integration.\
\
Prior to joining the University of Groningen, I worked as an Assistant Professor in Public Administration at the University of Canberra (2017-19), as a Research Associate at the University of Kent (2015-17) and as a Teaching Fellow in French and European Politics at the University of Bath (2014-15). I also held a visiting fellowship at the ARENA Centre for European Studies (University of Oslo) in 2012-13. \
\
I am the co-author and co-editor of various books, such as [Euroscepticism as a Transnational and pan-European Phenomenon](https://www.routledge.com/Euroscepticism-as-a-Transnational-and-Pan-European-Phenomenon-The-Emergence/FitzGibbon-Leruth-Startin/p/book/9781138917651) (Routledge, 2017); [After Austerity](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/after-austerity-9780198790266?cc=gb&lang=en&) (Oxford University Press, 2017); the [Routledge Handbook of Euroscepticism](https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Handbook-of-Euroscepticism/Startin-Usherwood-Leruth/p/book/9781138784741) (Routledge, 2018); [Attitudes, Aspirations and Welfare](https://www.palgrave.com/in/book/9783319757827) (Palgrave, 2018); and [Differentiated Integration and Disintegration in a Post-Brexit Era](https://www.routledge.com/Differentiated-Integration-and-Disintegration-in-a-Post-Brexit-Era-1st/Ganzle-Leruth-Trondal/p/book/9780367135300) (Routledge, 2020). My articles have been published in journals such as Policy & Politics, the Journal of European Public Policy, the Journal of Common Market Studies, Politics, Comparative European Politics, and Social Policy & Administration. Between 2017 and 2020 I was the co-director of the UACES-funded Research Network on “[Differentiated Integration in the European Union after Brexit](http://differentiated-integration.eu/)”.
